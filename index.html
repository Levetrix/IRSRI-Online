			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p class="aboutContent">The International Reservoir Simulation Research Institute was formed at Brigham Young University in July 1996. IRSRI is a new direction for a well-established research group. It is an attempt to make additional use of the resources of BYU's Advanced Combustion Engineering Research Center, ACERC, which was formed in 1986. One of ACERC's principal research areas has been the numerical simulation of combustion processes such as furnaces and turbines, a technology that has much in common with reservoir simulations. Since that inception IRSRI has gained the support of thirteen oil companies.</p>

			<p id="bioparagraph1" class="bio hide">ONE is a chemical engineer by training with a B.S. and M.S. degree from Brigham Young
University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Currently he is an assistant professor 
at Brigham Young University in the Chemical Engineering Department. Prior to BYU he worked as a 
consultant for Celanese, SABIC Ibn Zahr, ExxonMobil, TOTAL, and other companies on optimization 
solutions for chemical manufacture and then for 5 years with ExxonMobil Chemical supporting advanced
control and optimization solutions. Dr. Hedengren’s area of expertise is in process systems engineering 
with application areas in systems biology, the oil and gas industry, smart grid optimization, unmanned 
aerial systems, and nonlinear solver development.
